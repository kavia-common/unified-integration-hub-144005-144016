# PUBLIC_INTERFACE
# Base URL for the backend API used by the Next.js app.
# Typical local development:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3002

# If you run the backend bound to all interfaces or access via a non-localhost host,
# you may alternatively use:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://0.0.0.0:3002

# Copy this file to .env.local and adjust as needed. Do not commit .env.local.
